Star Classification Using Logistic Regression

**Project Overview**

This project aims to classify stars based on their spectral type using Logistic Regression. Stars can be classified into different spectral types, which are determined by their physical characteristics such as temperature, absolute magnitude, and radius. This project leverages a dataset containing these star attributes to build a predictive model that can accurately classify stars into their respective spectral types.

The Logistic Regression model built for this task achieved an accuracy of 89.5%, showcasing its effectiveness in distinguishing between different spectral types based on the available features.

**Dataset**
The dataset consists of 240 rows and 7 columns representing various properties of stars:

**Temperature (K)**: The surface temperature of the star.

**Luminosity (L/L₀)**: The brightness of the star relative to the Sun.

**Radius (R/R₀)**: The radius of the star relative to the Sun.

**Absolute Magnitude (Mv)**: The intrinsic brightness of the star.

**Star Type**: Categorical target variable representing the spectral type of the star.

**Star Color**: The color of the star, which can be related to its temperature.

**Spectral Class**: A classification based on the star's temperature and other properties.
